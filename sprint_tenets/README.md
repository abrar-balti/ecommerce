### Sprint Retro

### GitHub Ticket Management:

---

- We'll be using labels for organizing the tickets
- Primarily Epic label will be used for the user-stories related to one project i.e. epic_Sprint1
- Time estimation for a sprint should be 5 days
- If someone is unable to complete the sprint within 5 days, a proper justification should be provided to extend it to next week.
- When extending an issue to the next week, you're required to add another label as `moved-from-<sprint-name>`
