# PR Review and SLA

<!-- Xgrid Learning and Development Program -->

This file explains how you'll be working within your forked and central repository.

### Pull Request Process

---

- First of all, Fork your target repo e.g. [app-bootcamp-2023](https://github.com/Xgrid-Engineering/app-bootcamp-2023)
- Create a folder with your name inside submissions folder, and in the folder of your name create the sprint folder. e.g submissions/saad/sprint1/.
- Rest of the work will be done in Forked Repository within your folders
- After completing the code, a PR needs to be created from the fork respository to the dev app-bootcamp-2023
- Then someone has to review and approve your code
- At the end, you'll be able to merge the code in the dev branch.

### Service Level Agreement:

---

- PR should be against <target_repo>/main e-g app-bootcamp-2023/dev
- An opened PR must be reviewed within 24h of opening.
- It is the responsibility of the PR owner, to get others to review and approve his PR
- There can be as many PRs at a given point as required.
