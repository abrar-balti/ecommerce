# Submissions

This directory contains the submissions for the training program. Each student has their own folder, and within each folder, there are subfolders for each sprint containing their code.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure for submissions is as follows:

- `Student Name`
  - `Sprint Name`
    - `App.py` (Code file(s) for the sprint)
    - `README.md` (Documentation for the sprint)

## How to Submit Code

To submit your code for a sprint, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder with your name under the `Submissions` directory.
2. Inside your folder, create a subfolder with the name of the sprint.
3. Place your code file(s) for the sprint (e.g., `App.py`) inside the sprint folder.
4. Create a readme file (`README.md`) in the sprint folder to document your work.

## Guidelines for Sprint Documentation (README.md)

The readme file in each sprint folder should provide the following information:

- Description of the sprint task or requirements.
- Explanation of how you approached the task and any challenges faced.
- Instructions for running or deploying the code.
- Any additional notes or observations.

Make sure your documentation is clear, concise, and follows best practices.

## Evaluation Process

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Demo**: The code should be running correctly during the demo.
- **Edge Cases**: Consideration of edge cases in the code.
- **Viva**: Ability to explain and discuss the code during the evaluation.
- **Test Cases (Bonus)**: Writing and including unit tests, if applicable.
- **Participation**: Active participation, engagement, and coordination with peers.
- **Communication**: Timely communication, reporting blockers, and addressing feedback.
- **Documentation**: Well-documented code and readme files.

Please refer to the main repository for the complete grading and evaluation process.
