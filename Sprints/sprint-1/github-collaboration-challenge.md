# Exercise: GitHub Collaboration Challenge

## Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to assess your proficiency in forking a GitHub repository, creating a pull request, following the review process, and resolving a merge conflict.

## Instructions:

* Fork the "app-bootcamp-2023" repository: Visit the repository at [repository URL](https://github.com/Xgrid-Engineering/app-bootcamp-2023/) and fork it to your own GitHub account.
* Add a text file about yourself: In your forked repository, create a new text file named "about_me.txt" in the submissions folder.
* In this file, provide a brief description about yourself, including your background, skills, and interests. Feel free to be creative and showcase your personality.
* Create a Pull Request: Initiate a pull request from your forked repository to the "dev" branch of the main "app-bootcamp-2023" repository.
* Ensure that your pull request title and description are clear and descriptive, and that you follow the [Pull-Request-Template](https://github.com/Xgrid-Engineering/app-bootcamp-2023/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull-request-template.md)
* Follow the review process: Actively monitor your pull request for any feedback or comments from the reviewers.
* Address the feedback by making necessary changes to your "about_me.txt" file or resolving any other issues raised during the review process.
* Engage in constructive discussions with the reviewers to improve your submission.
* Time limit: You have 24 hours to complete the review process and address any feedback you receive. Aim to close the pull request within this time frame.
* Introduce a merge conflict: After you have received reviews and made the necessary changes, a merge conflict will be introduced in your pull request branch.
* Resolve the conflict by carefully merging the conflicting changes and updating your pull request accordingly.
* If you require guidance on resolving merge conflicts using Git, refer to the provided resources or seek assistance from the reviewers.
